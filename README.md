## :star2: About the Project

When you open this weather app, you will see the default weather conditions in Taiwan.<br>
You can search for the weather in a specific city by entering the city name in the search bar.<br>
To avoid performance issues caused by frequent searching, we implemented debounce technology.<br>
The search request will only be sent after you stop typing for 1500 milliseconds, providing a better user experience.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, we developed this application using TypeScript.<br>
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with powerful type checking capabilities.<br>
It can catch many errors during development, making the code more stable and reliable.<br>
